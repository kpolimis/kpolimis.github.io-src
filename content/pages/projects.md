The DisCont (Discontinuities in Household and Family Formation) project examines the impact of macro-level discontinuities on household and family formation (including fertility) in post-industrial contemporary societies. Household, family and fertility changes are key drivers of population dynamics. Discovering and explaining the velocity of these changes is essential to understand the current situation and to provide scientific evidence on demographic future.

This project advances the study of global family change (GFC) by exploring the complex ways in which families are changing across low and middle-income countries (LMICs). The innovation of the project lies in the premise that we need better foundations for understanding why and how families change on a global scale
