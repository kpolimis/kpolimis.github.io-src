Welcome to my website. My name is Kivan and I'm currently a Ph.D candidate at the University of Washington. My research focuses on health development and applying statistical techniques to investigate health disparities. As a computational social scientist, I'm interested in structural inequality, machine learning, and developing programming solutions to real-world problems.

Also, I'm passionate about growing the community of computational social scientists and teach in [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/
) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) Workshops.

If you are interested in contacting me, email kivan.polimis@gmail.com
