    "# Triple Double Russ\n",

    "In this post, we use webscraping to analyze Russell (Russ) Westbrook's team performance when he records a triple double. We will use multiple Python modules and focus on `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "[Russell Westbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook) is a lightning rod for discussion in the NBA because of his style of play and clashes with popular players like his [beef with former teammate Kevin Durant](https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-basketball-news-how-kevin-durant-and-russell-westbrook-went-from-close-teammates-to-having-beef-with-each-other/). Westbrook's high energy, domineering style of play is best characterized by the the statistic he is known for, the triple double.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a triple double?\n",
    "Traditional NBA [box scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_score) collect statistics on 5 individual player categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1). When a player has 10 or more instances of each category (\"double\") in 3 categories (\"triple), the collective statisitcal feat is known as a triple double. Westbrook is the [NBA leader in career triple doubles](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trp_dbl_career.html) and recently [broke Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson's 47 year-old record](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/wizards/2021/05/10/russell-westbrook-breaks-oscar-robertsons-nba-triple-double-record/5031401001/) in the 2020-21 season. Robertson was the original \"Mr. Triple Double\" and [some have used the moniker](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/russell-westbrook-is-officially-mr-triple-double-but-his-legacy-is-complicated) with Russ. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is controverisial about Russ and the triple double?\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many supporters of Westbrook in print and video, including [videos praising Russ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na8lIRryd-o) for his ability to create triple doubles, there is also considerable pushback of Russ' pursuit of a triple double. Check the [plays compiled in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8erK7T_LIQ) for instance. At the time of the compiled plays, Westbrook is 2 assists shy of a triple double and declines to take several open shots in order to pass the ball to a teammate in the hopes of getting an assist. Several plays are awkward with Westbrook putting teammates in bad positions and some plays ending in turnovers. For me, the most egregious example of a player selfishly pursuing a triple double is [Ricky Davis in 2003](https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1169419607158841344). With seconds remaining in the game his team was winning by 25, Davis attempted a shot on his team's basket in order to secure what he hoped would be his 10th rebound and a triple double (Davis was not credited with the rebound or triple double). That Westbrook video is nothing near the cynicism of Davis, but the discussion prompted by Russ' triple double ability is: \"Do Westbrook's teams win more games when he creates a triple double?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate Russ' team performance when he creates a triple double we need to gather his individual statistics and team performance during his games. We can gather both sources of information from [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and create a function to tabulate triple doubles. Then we will compare the win percentage of Westbrook's teams when he does and does not have a triple double to assess if his pursuit of a triple doubles negatively impacts team performance. We will subset our analysis to only Westbrook's Regular Season games\n",
