Welcome to my website.

My name is Kivan and I am excited that you are here.

Currently, I live in Houston, Texas where I am a Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of <a href = "https://cjo.harriscountytx.gov" target="_blank">Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo</a>. I am also a Senior Data Scientist with Atlas Analytics and a Regional Affiliate at the University of Washington's Center for the Study of Demography and Ecology <a href = "https://csde.washington.edu" target="_blank">(CSDE)</a>.

Most recently, I was a Data Scientist with <a href="https://maana.io" target="_blank">MAANA</a> after completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Universit√† Bocconi's <a href="http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/Cdr/Centro_Dondena/Home" target="_blank"> Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy</a> in Milan where I was also a Research Affiliate at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics <a href = "http://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home" target="_blank">(BIDSA)</a>.

My research focuses on combining computational social science approaches with
alternative data (e.g., demographic data from the Facebook Marketing API) and traditional data (e.g. American Community Survey) to evaluate population dynamics such as migration patterns during a disaster. As a computational
social scientist, my interests include structural inequality, natural language processing,
and developing programming solutions (policy and software) to social problems. I'm passionate
about growing the community of computational social scientists and teach in <a href="https://software-carpentry.org" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> and
 <a href="https://datacarpentry.org" target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a> Workshops.
