Predicting Career NFL Performance with Combine Data
===================================================
collaborators: Long Chen, Melaku Dubie, Rich Lee and Kivan Polimis

## Background
Every year, hundreds of collegiate football players are invited to participate in a week-long scouting combine. Players are evaluated by NFL personnel departments on a series of physical and mental tests. Results from these “measurables” influence positioning in the ensuing NFL draft months after the combine. Our goal with this project was to determine the association between pre-draft metrics and career performance

Press the [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/kpolimis/nflcombineevaluationnotebooks){:target="_blank"} link to open a jupyter notebook directory window.
Select plots.ipynb to start an interactive notebook that plots the relationship between assorted Combine
metrics (40 time, vertical, speed score, etc.) and total yards in a NFL career for quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers

In this repository, we build functions that gather and evaluate the relationship between pre-draft Combine metrics and career NFL performance
