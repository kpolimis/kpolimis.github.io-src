Welcome to my website. My name is Kivan and I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from the
University of Washington. In Seattle, I worked with Data Science for Social Good
and Microsoft to develop programming solutions in transportation infrastructure
and the legal system. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher at
Universit√† Bocconi's <a href="http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/Cdr/Centro_Dondena/Home">
Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics and Public Policy</a> in Milan.
I am also a postdoctoral affiliate at the Bocconi Institute for
Data Science and Analytics <a href = "http://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home">(BIDSA)</a>.

My research focuses  on combining computational social science approaches with
large scale social media to evaluate population dynamics. As a computational
social scientist, my interests include structural inequality, machine learning,
and developing programming solutions to social problems. I'm passionate
about growing the community of computational social scientists and teach in
 [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and
 [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) Workshops.
